Changelog Time!

New and improved Deck Manager!
Sort cards, build multiple decks and do more with the new deck manager
It's much better than the old system, and supports a lot more cards!


Icons:
Added Icons for entities to make it more clear on how they react to their environment

XP Amount:
Can now see values above 20

Cards:
Piglin Bartering:
Piglin bartering never felt like a useful card in play, and now feels quite powerful, but requires a decent set up
Cost 5 -> 1

Emerald:
Similar to Piglin Bartering, but emerald is more versatile, so less of a buff
Cost 5 -> 2

Splash Poison Potion:
Felt not very useful, especially with poison immunity by undead, reduced price to compensate
Cost 12 -> 8

Golden Apple:
While some cards dealt a lot of damage, Golden apple was a little too expensive to be worthwhile
Cost 6 -> 4

Zombified Piglin:
It's stats were just way above everything else of the similar cost, so a minor nerf
Cost 4 -> 5

Creeper:
Creeper never felt like a threat, which is obviously a problem.  Attack and cost have been changed
Special Attack - Explodes after you end your turn (previously after 3 end of turns)
Cost 3 -> 5

Charged Creeper:
Same buff as creeper to special attack, but cost remains the same due to how easy it is to blow up your own units.
Special Attack - Explodes after you end your turn (previously after 3 end of turns)

Diorite:
Diorite was impossible to attack if you didn't have a melee mob on hand.  This is no fun, so changes were made to rebalance it to give more ways to attack it.
Now Blinds a random adjacent entity
Health 5 -> 3

Spawner:
Spawner was also quite impossible to attack because of board control loss.  I reworked it to be a bit more balanced while remaining useful.
Now only spawns up to 4 silverfish total
Cost 10 -> 7
Health 6 -> 5
Armor 3 -> 1

Bee Hive:
Bee hive was just super annoying and was never fun to attack.  Some changes were made to make it more of an early game boost rather than a late game pester.
Cost 12 -> 8
Health 6 -> 10
Now takes 1 damage for every bee spawned

Bee Nest:
Same as before, but because it was somewhat useless on it's own, you also discover a bee to help snowball the bee buffing
Also discovers a bee on summon

Flint and Steel:
Too expensive.  Not worthwhile to have because of it's lack of usability vs. price.
Cost 9 -> 5

Wither Trap:
I really like traps, but they are hard to get full value.  Because of this, I think reducing price a little bit will make them more viable
Cost 4 -> 3

Lava Pocket:
Same as above
Cost 7 -> 4

Skeleton Trap:
Even though it's really powerful, still faces the same problem as the above traps.  Slightly reduced cost
Cost 20 -> 18

Silverfish:
Why was this card so expensive?  It's not good, and is of little use other than to waste a turn or get 1 free damage, cost reduced greatly.
Cost 3 -> 0

Cobblestone:
All values reduced to be more of a minor hindrance than a major one.
Cost 4 -> 2
Health 5 -> 2

Witch Hut:
That's a lot of health... Reworked to still be useful for it's lower health
Health 10 -> 5
Chance to gain potion 10% -> 25%

Farmland:
A really good card, wanted to make it more of a target to destroy
Health 5 -> 4

Water:
while it is a very powerful card, it was a bit too expensive
Cost 7 -> 5

Gilded Blackstone:
Reduced health and cost like other simpler blocks
Cost 4 -> 3
Health 5 -> 3

Outpost:
I like outpost as a good line of defense or attack, but I wanted to make attacking it a little easier
Health 6 -> 4

Targets:
I don't see these being used much other than as a shield to waste a turn, so health reduced and cost reduced
Health 7 -> 4
Cost 10 -> 9

Well:
A really powerful card that can be used to quickly heal your units.  Reducing health makes it more of a possibility to kill your own well before your opponent uses it against you.
Health 5 -> 3

TNT:
While useful for keeping enemies at bay, it took too long to detonate, making it easily avoided and ignored, fuse time shortened
Fuse Turns: 4 -> 2

Thunderstorm:
I really like this card, but mostly how it's a huge game changer depending on complete luck.  There is a little too much luck involved with such a high cost card, so cost is reduced
Cost 15 -> 13

TNT Cannon:
I like the clear potential of this card, but because of giving an opportunity to flee for faster mobs, a cost buff will help with it's value potential
Cost 16 -> 14

Dolphin:
Another case of why was this so expensive, also removed attack for more hay bale synergy
Cost 9 -> 4
Damage 1 -> 0

Killer Rabbit:
It just didn't make sense for this guy to spawn with 1 armor, removing it will increase the value of putting armor/healing on him
Armor 1 -> 0

Pillager:
Pillager had the same stats as piglin, except having 1 more health.  This plus the pillager's better buff (using emeralds) warrants a cost nerf
Cost 8 -> 9

Guardian:
His eye beam attack was impossible to go up against, I reduced damage, and hopefully it will be good enough for now
Attack 5 -> 3

Elder Guardian:
Same issue as above, but also gave a minor health buff to compensate
Attack 7 -> 5
Health 5 -> 7

Evoker:
Was very hard to counter before it overwhelmed the board
Health 9 -> 7

Baby Magma Cube:
Another cost adjustment
Cost 4 -> 2
