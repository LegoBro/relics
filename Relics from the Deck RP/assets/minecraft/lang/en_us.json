"tutorial.3":"Meanwhile, you try to protect your hero.",
"tutorial.4":"To do this, you use a deck of cards.",
"tutorial.5":"Right click with the arrow while looking at your deck to draw a card.  This cost 2 experience.",
"tutorial.6":"You drew a Zombie card!",
"tutorial.7":"As you see, this card has 6 stats, and a description.",
"tutorial.8":"The first stat is experience.",
"tutorial.9":"Experience is the cost of the card.",
"tutorial.10":"The second icon is the health of the entity.",
"tutorial.11":"The third icon is how much damage the entity deals.",
"tutorial.12":"The fourth icon is how much armor the entity starts with.",
"tutorial.13":"Armor is similar to health, but must be completely broken before health can be taken.",
"tutorial.14":"The fifth icon is speed.",
"tutorial.15":"The faster the mob, the further it can travel in a single move.",
"tutorial.16":"Finally, we have range.",
"tutorial.17":"Range is like speed, but it deals with how far away the entity can deal damage.",
"tutorial.18":"Also, don't forget to read the description; sometimes cards have bonus traits that you can use.",
"tutorial.19":"You can't afford to use this card yet, so end your turn by dropping an arrow or a card.",
"tutorial.20":"Normally, it would be your opponent's turn, but I will skip for now.",
"tutorial.21":"Now you can place your entity card.",
"tutorial.22":"To do this, look at the board, and click where you want it to go.",
"tutorial.23":"Keep in mind, that green highlighting means you can place, and red means you can not.",
"tutorial.24":"Excellent!  You can look at any entity on the board to see it's stats.",
"tutorial.25":"Notice that if you hold the arrow, the spot where the zombie is standing is red.",
"tutorial.26":"This means that the entity can not move currently.",
"tutorial.27":"Most entities can't move the same turn they are placed.",
"tutorial.28":"To move your zombie, you must end your turn.",
"tutorial.29":"I skipped my turn again.  Use this chance to move your zombie.",
"tutorial.30":"To do this, use the arrow to select your zombie, and select a square adjacent to move it.",
"tutorial.31":"Great!  Now you know how to move your entities around.",
"tutorial.32":"But entities can do a lot more than move, they can also attack!",
"tutorial.33":"Please, end your turn.",
"tutorial.34":"I will place a chicken for you to attack.",
"tutorial.35":"Try to kill this chicken by attacking it.  Attacking works the same way as moving, but you must select a hostile entity.",
"tutorial.36":"Nice job!  I'm going to clear the cobblestone from the board now, and I'll show you another type of card.",
"tutorial.37":"If you look to the card pile again, try to draw another card.",
"tutorial.38":"Great, you just drew a Speed Potion.",
"tutorial.39":"Speed potions are just one of many cards in the consumable category.",
"tutorial.40":"Consumable cards can help strengthen your units, create defenses, or even launch attacks.",
"tutorial.41":"Knowing which consumable card to place and when can greatly improve your strategy.",
"tutorial.42":"Use this speed potion on your Zombie.",
"tutorial.43":"The speed potion is applied to the zombie, and it can now move 2 tiles instead of just 1 per turn.",
"tutorial.44":"That's the core of the game, but I will discuss a few minor details that are important now.",
"tutorial.45":"First of all, in a normal game, your deck is quite limited.",
"tutorial.46":"You only have 27 cards to use, so your deck makes up for this by shuffling in older cards.",
"tutorial.47":"Also, you can only have 8 drawn cards at once.",
"tutorial.48":"Another thing you may have noticed is that after each turn your experience went up a small amount.",
"tutorial.49":"Your experience goes up 1 every turn until it reaches 20, where it is capped.",
"tutorial.50":"You now know the basics of this game, but there is much to still learn.",
"tutorial.51":"To make sure you can play a game, try to kill my hero.",
"tutorial.52":"I'll restore your entire deck, and I'll skip my turns.",
"tutorial.53":"I'll make it easy for you by not attacking back.",
"tutorial.54":"Good luck!",
"tutorial.55":"Great work!  It looks like you have figured out how to play.  I'll send you back to the lobby.",
