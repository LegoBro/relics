#### Saving and Loading Decks:
Due to changes between versions, going from one version to another will delete your decks.  This does not mean you lose any of your collection, just that you will have to rebuild your 27 card decks.

## 2.0

### New and improved Deck Manager!
Sort cards, build multiple decks and do more with the new deck manager
It's much better than the old system, and supports a lot more cards!


### Icons:
Added Icons for entities to make it more clear on how they react to their environment

### XP Amount:
Can now see values above 20

### Cards:
#### Piglin Bartering:
Piglin bartering never felt like a useful card in play, and now feels quite powerful, but requires a decent set up
Cost 5 -> 1

#### Emerald:
Similar to Piglin Bartering, but emerald is more versatile, so less of a buff
Cost 5 -> 2

#### Splash Poison Potion:
Felt not very useful, especially with poison immunity by undead, reduced price to compensate
Cost 12 -> 8

#### Golden Apple:
While some cards dealt a lot of damage, Golden apple was a little too expensive to be worthwhile
Cost 6 -> 4

#### Zombified Piglin:
It's stats were just way above everything else of the similar cost, so a minor nerf
Cost 4 -> 5

#### Creeper:
Creeper never felt like a threat, which is obviously a problem.  Attack and cost have been changed
Special Attack - Explodes after you end your turn (previously after 3 end of turns)
Cost 3 -> 5

#### Charged Creeper:
Same buff as creeper to special attack, but cost remains the same due to how easy it is to blow up your own units.
Special Attack - Explodes after you end your turn (previously after 3 end of turns)

#### Diorite:
Diorite was impossible to attack if you didn't have a melee mob on hand.  This is no fun, so changes were made to rebalance it to give more ways to attack it.
Now Blinds a random adjacent entity
Health 5 -> 3

#### Spawner:
Spawner was also quite impossible to attack because of board control loss.  I reworked it to be a bit more balanced while remaining useful.
Now only spawns up to 4 silverfish total
Cost 10 -> 7
Health 6 -> 5
Armor 3 -> 1

#### Bee Hive:
Bee hive was just super annoying and was never fun to attack.  Some changes were made to make it more of an early game boost rather than a late game pester.
Cost 12 -> 8
Health 6 -> 10
Now takes 1 damage for every bee spawned

#### Bee Nest:
Same as before, but because it was somewhat useless on it's own, you also discover a bee to help snowball the bee buffing
Also discovers a bee on summon

#### Flint and Steel:
Too expensive.  Not worthwhile to have because of it's lack of usability vs. price.
Cost 9 -> 5

#### Wither Trap:
I really like traps, but they are hard to get full value.  Because of this, I think reducing price a little bit will make them more viable
Cost 4 -> 3

#### Lava Pocket:
Same as above
Cost 7 -> 4

#### Skeleton Trap:
Even though it's really powerful, still faces the same problem as the above traps.  Slightly reduced cost
Cost 20 -> 18

#### Silverfish:
Why was this card so expensive?  It's not good, and is of little use other than to waste a turn or get 1 free damage, cost reduced greatly.
Cost 3 -> 0

#### Cobblestone:
All values reduced to be more of a minor hindrance than a major one.
Cost 4 -> 2
Health 5 -> 2

#### Witch Hut:
That's a lot of health... Reworked to still be useful for it's lower health
Health 10 -> 5
Chance to gain potion 10% -> 25%

#### Farmland:
A really good card, wanted to make it more of a target to destroy
Health 5 -> 4

#### Water:
while it is a very powerful card, it was a bit too expensive
Cost 7 -> 5

#### Gilded Blackstone:
Reduced health and cost like other simpler blocks
Cost 4 -> 3
Health 5 -> 3

#### Outpost:
I like outpost as a good line of defense or attack, but I wanted to make attacking it a little easier
Health 6 -> 4

#### Targets:
I don't see these being used much other than as a shield to waste a turn, so health reduced and cost reduced
Health 7 -> 4
Cost 10 -> 9

#### Well:
A really powerful card that can be used to quickly heal your units.  Reducing health makes it more of a possibility to kill your own well before your opponent uses it against you.
Health 5 -> 3

#### TNT:
While useful for keeping enemies at bay, it took too long to detonate, making it easily avoided and ignored, fuse time shortened
Fuse Turns: 4 -> 2

#### Thunderstorm:
I really like this card, but mostly how it's a huge game changer depending on complete luck.  There is a little too much luck involved with such a high cost card, so cost is reduced
Cost 15 -> 13

#### TNT Cannon:
I like the clear potential of this card, but because of giving an opportunity to flee for faster mobs, a cost buff will help with it's value potential
Cost 16 -> 14

#### Dolphin:
Another case of why was this so expensive, also removed attack for more hay bale synergy
Cost 9 -> 4
Damage 1 -> 0

#### Killer Rabbit:
It just didn't make sense for this guy to spawn with 1 armor, removing it will increase the value of putting armor/healing on him
Armor 1 -> 0

#### Pillager:
Pillager had the same stats as piglin, except having 1 more health.  This plus the pillager's better buff (using emeralds) warrants a cost nerf
Cost 8 -> 9

#### Guardian:
His eye beam attack was impossible to go up against, I reduced damage, and hopefully it will be good enough for now
Attack 5 -> 3

#### Elder Guardian:
Same issue as above, but also gave a minor health buff to compensate
Attack 7 -> 5
Health 5 -> 7

#### Evoker:
Was very hard to counter before it overwhelmed the board
Health 9 -> 7

#### Baby Magma Cube:
Another cost adjustment
Cost 4 -> 2
