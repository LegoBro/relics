### Updates

### New Card Traits

### New Cards

Bogged - Skeleton that gives poison

#### Buff
Saddle - Combine two entities by taking the ridden entity's health and speed, and the rider's attack and range.
Iron Spear - Increase range of melee mob by 1 for 3 turns (Still has melee movement)
Iron Sword - Convert a Ranged mob into a melee one, giving +3 Attack

#### Defend
Enchantment Table - Every enchanted Book gets refunded 1 XP

### Card Change Ideas
Silverfish - Hidden Friends Ability now deals 1 damage to all buildings, when one is broken, it spawns a silverfish
Turtle Egg - Hatches Faster, Armor Reduced by 1 (From 1 to 0)
Chorus Fruit - Now guaranteed to work, but requires a board spot to be open
Piercing - Cost Reduced by 2 (From 8 to 6)
Piglin - Cost Reduced by 1 (From 8 to 7)
Outpost - Cost Increased by 3 (From 9 to 12), Health Increased by 2 (From 4 to 6), Adjacent damage increased by 1 (From 1 to 2)
Pillager - Damage Increased by 1 (From 1 to 2)
Targets - Cost Decreased by 2 (From 9 to 7)
Hay Bale - only apply if existing or don't apply until end of turn

Lightning Rod - ??? Too niche
Stickypiston and Piston - merged into one card, hold shift while using "Piston" to pull, otherwise push, cost is 6
Guardian - Damage Increased by 1 (From 3 to 4)
Ice Storm - Now ignores frozen mobs, instead giving them speed and haste
Warden - Now heals +5HP to full every entity it kills, +1 Speed
Miner's Resilience - Only steals 1 or 1/2 total armor, whichever is higher from every entity
Evoker - Cost Reduced by 5 (From 20 to 15), Range Increased by 1 (From 1 to 2), Now only spawns a Vex on a successful attack
Pitcher Plant - Make not useless???
--Redstone's Ideas--
Armorsmith - Only buffs allies
Butcher - significantly reduce cost
Camel - feels too clunky to use, a lower cost would allow minecart or haste synergy, but would make it realistically too strong, debuffing its stats would contend with the goat. Perhaps a rework of some sort?
Cleric - only heal allies, possibly reduce healing done to compensate
Goat - increase damage by 1, reduce health by 1 - makes the ability on it more useful without need for goat horn
Librarian - Change to: Whenever a mob is enchanted, give it +2 health; …
Mooshroom - less health, guaranteed food
Well - only target allies

### Card Changes
#### Entities
Drowned - Impaler changed to require 2 other drowned to give trident, then 100% chance.
    We didn't like the uncertainty of this card, and wanted to focus on adding value to synergistic cards such as pottery sherd
Baby Magma Cube - Cost Reduced by 1 ( From 2 to 1)
    Baby Magma Cube fell far behind some similar cards that are cheaper
Horse - Attack decreased by 1 (From 1 to 0), gained Passive trait
    Horse having one attack is kind of confusing in reference to the other passive entities, and will actually make for a better synergy with Hay Bale
Pig - Increased health by +1 (From 2 to 3), gained passive trait
    This change helps pig stand out a little more between chicken and sheep, as generally 2 chickens would be a better card combo
Frog - Health Reduced by 1 (From 3 to 2)
    Because aquatic entities have more synergies, we didn't want frog spam to be extremely strong.
Parrot - Now only mimics allies
    This now allows better synergies and deck composition opportunities
Fox - Damage Decreased by 1 (From 3 to 2), Chance to discover item changed to 100% (from 50%), Gained Frozen trait
    The cards fox gave were never really powerful, so making them 100% chance gives a lot more reason to use fox in early game decks.
    
##### Minor Entity Changes
Phantom - Special Ability moved into Evasive trait
Cub - Gained frozen trait
Polar Bear - Gained frozen trait
Vex - Gained Illager trait
Goat - Gained Lunging trait
Husk - Now has description for having higher max health
Camel - Gained lunging trait
Sheep - Better explained special ability "Wooly Armor", gained passive trait
Stray - Gained frozen trait
Witch - Gained Illager trait
Evoker - Gained Illager Trait
Spider - Gained arthropod trait
Warden - Changed description
Chicken - Gained passive trait
Ravager - Gained illager trait
Sniffer - Changed description, gained passive trait
Pillager - Gained Illager trait
Mooshroom - Gained passive trait
Silverfish - gained arthropod trait
Snow Golem - gained frozen trait
Turtle Egg - now no longer selectable or buffable
Vindicator - gained illager trait
Cave Spider - gained arthropod trait
Killer Rabbit - gained frozen trait


#### Attack

#### Buff

#### Defense
Sculk Block - Health Increased by 1 (From 1 to 2)
    A lot of the time, sculk block can function as a better version of bread, especially if placed in front of the hero, so increasing health will help make it more nuanced.
Gilded Blackstone - Chance to discover item changed to 100% (Was 50%)
    Gilded blackstone didn't make sense in general, so changing the discover item to be 100% will give it value as a defensive block that can propagate into a more aggressive next turn.
Cobblestone - Cost Reduced by 2 (From 2 to 0)
    Cobblestone doesn't really do anything, so reducing it's cost will better situate it into being an early game defense.
Witch Hut - Renamed to "Alchemy Hut", changed ability to return +2XP for every potion used, health increased by 1 (From 5 to 6), armor decreased by 2 (from 2 to 0)
    Alchemy hut never really made sense as a structure, so changing it's core gameplay to enhance the use of normal potions will fit into more strategies.

### Fixes
Bee Hive last spawn (when building breaks) spawns bee as enemy team -> spawn before destroy?
Draw game settings don't apply properly
Farmland talks about saturation -> XP on texture
Clear Totem of Dying Effects after use
Husk - mention the increased max hp on the card
Fletcher - clear up wording - currently unclear whether it is a on play effect or continuous effect.
Changed Bee card to properly show that it only has 2 poison instead of 3

### Improvements to do
Multi-Open Card pack
Convert all texts to translatable strings
Convert Heroes into mannequins
Sharable decks or suggested decks

Due to changes between versions, going from one version to another will delete your decks.  This does not mean you lose any of your collection, just that you will have to rebuild your 27 card decks.

## 2.0

### New and improved Deck Manager!
Sort cards, build multiple decks and do more with the new deck manager
It's much better than the old system, and supports a lot more cards!


### Icons:
Added Icons for entities to make it more clear on how they react to their environment

### XP Amount:
Can now see values above 20

### Cards:
#### Piglin Bartering:
Piglin bartering never felt like a useful card in play, and now feels quite powerful, but requires a decent set up
Cost 5 -> 1

#### Emerald:
Similar to Piglin Bartering, but emerald is more versatile, so less of a buff
Cost 5 -> 2

#### Splash Poison Potion:
Felt not very useful, especially with poison immunity by undead, reduced price to compensate
Cost 12 -> 8

#### Golden Apple:
While some cards dealt a lot of damage, Golden apple was a little too expensive to be worthwhile
Cost 6 -> 4

#### Zombified Piglin:
It's stats were just way above everything else of the similar cost, so a minor nerf
Cost 4 -> 5

#### Creeper:
Creeper never felt like a threat, which is obviously a problem.  Attack and cost have been changed
Special Attack - Explodes after you end your turn (previously after 3 end of turns)
Cost 3 -> 5

#### Charged Creeper:
Same buff as creeper to special attack, but cost remains the same due to how easy it is to blow up your own units.
Special Attack - Explodes after you end your turn (previously after 3 end of turns)

#### Diorite:
Diorite was impossible to attack if you didn't have a melee mob on hand.  This is no fun, so changes were made to rebalance it to give more ways to attack it.
Now Blinds a random adjacent entity
Health 5 -> 3

#### Spawner:
Spawner was also quite impossible to attack because of board control loss.  I reworked it to be a bit more balanced while remaining useful.
Now only spawns up to 4 silverfish total
Cost 10 -> 7
Health 6 -> 5
Armor 3 -> 1

#### Bee Hive:
Bee hive was just super annoying and was never fun to attack.  Some changes were made to make it more of an early game boost rather than a late game pester.
Cost 12 -> 8
Health 6 -> 10
Now takes 1 damage for every bee spawned

#### Bee Nest:
Same as before, but because it was somewhat useless on it's own, you also discover a bee to help snowball the bee buffing
Also discovers a bee on summon

#### Flint and Steel:
Too expensive.  Not worthwhile to have because of it's lack of usability vs. price.
Cost 9 -> 5

#### Wither Trap:
I really like traps, but they are hard to get full value.  Because of this, I think reducing price a little bit will make them more viable
Cost 4 -> 3

#### Lava Pocket:
Same as above
Cost 7 -> 4

#### Skeleton Trap:
Even though it's really powerful, still faces the same problem as the above traps.  Slightly reduced cost
Cost 20 -> 18

#### Silverfish:
Why was this card so expensive?  It's not good, and is of little use other than to waste a turn or get 1 free damage, cost reduced greatly.
Cost 3 -> 0

#### Cobblestone:
All values reduced to be more of a minor hindrance than a major one.
Cost 4 -> 2
Health 5 -> 2

#### Witch Hut:
That's a lot of health... Reworked to still be useful for it's lower health
Health 10 -> 5
Chance to gain potion 10% -> 25%

#### Farmland:
A really good card, wanted to make it more of a target to destroy
Health 5 -> 4

#### Water:
while it is a very powerful card, it was a bit too expensive
Cost 7 -> 5

#### Gilded Blackstone:
Reduced health and cost like other simpler blocks
Cost 4 -> 3
Health 5 -> 3

#### Outpost:
I like outpost as a good line of defense or attack, but I wanted to make attacking it a little easier
Health 6 -> 4

#### Targets:
I don't see these being used much other than as a shield to waste a turn, so health reduced and cost reduced
Health 7 -> 4
Cost 10 -> 9

#### Well:
A really powerful card that can be used to quickly heal your units.  Reducing health makes it more of a possibility to kill your own well before your opponent uses it against you.
Health 5 -> 3

#### TNT:
While useful for keeping enemies at bay, it took too long to detonate, making it easily avoided and ignored, fuse time shortened
Fuse Turns: 4 -> 2

#### Thunderstorm:
I really like this card, but mostly how it's a huge game changer depending on complete luck.  There is a little too much luck involved with such a high cost card, so cost is reduced
Cost 15 -> 13

#### TNT Cannon:
I like the clear potential of this card, but because of giving an opportunity to flee for faster mobs, a cost buff will help with it's value potential
Cost 16 -> 14

#### Dolphin:
Another case of why was this so expensive, also removed attack for more hay bale synergy
Cost 9 -> 4
Damage 1 -> 0

#### Killer Rabbit:
It just didn't make sense for this guy to spawn with 1 armor, removing it will increase the value of putting armor/healing on him
Armor 1 -> 0

#### Pillager:
Pillager had the same stats as piglin, except having 1 more health.  This plus the pillager's better buff (using emeralds) warrants a cost nerf
Cost 8 -> 9

#### Guardian:
His eye beam attack was impossible to go up against, I reduced damage, and hopefully it will be good enough for now
Attack 5 -> 3

#### Elder Guardian:
Same issue as above, but also gave a minor health buff to compensate
Attack 7 -> 5
Health 5 -> 7

#### Evoker:
Was very hard to counter before it overwhelmed the board
Health 9 -> 7

#### Baby Magma Cube:
Another cost adjustment
Cost 4 -> 2
